# Simple-MakeFile-C

This repository shows how to implement a simple MakeFile for the C programming language. 

The make file uses the gcc compiler, links object files, and cleans the directory of any object files and the app itself. To run the MakeFile simply type make into the terminal. To clean the directory simply type make clean.
